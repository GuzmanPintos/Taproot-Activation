## Taproot is a proposed Bitcoin protocol upgrade that can be deployed as a forward-compatible soft fork. By combining the Schnorr signature algorithm with MAST (Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees) and a new scripting language called Tapscript, Taproot will expand Bitcoinâ€™s smart contract flexibility, while offering more privacy by letting users mask complex smart contracts as a regular bitcoin transaction.
More in depth information can be found in this Bitcoin Magazine article by Aaron van Wirdum [Taproot Is Coming: What It Is, And How It Will Benefit Bitcoin](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin)

A soft fork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is forward-compatible. See more here: [Soft fork bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Softfork)

## Proposal overview

More in-depth information on Taproot activation can be found in the Bitcoin Wiki [Taproot activation proposals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Taproot_activation_proposals)
 
**The aim of this site is to assist in the activation of the Taproot soft fork. We have reached out to several Bitcoin mining pools to find out if:**
 
1. If they support the Taproot upgrade
1. If so, which activation method they prefer
1. What threshold hash power percentage should be met to activate the upgrade
1. If they want to insert a coinbase message in a block to announce their preference (even before the actual activation window opens)
