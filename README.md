## Taproot is a proposed Bitcoin protocol upgrade that can be deployed as a forward-compatible soft fork. By combining the Schnorr signature algorithm with MAST (Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees) and a new scripting language called Tapscript, Taproot will expand Bitcoinâ€™s smart contract flexibility, while offering more privacy by letting users mask complex smart contracts as a regular bitcoin transaction.

A soft fork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is forward-compatible. See more here: [Soft fork bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Softfork) 

Soft forks can be activated in several ways. Several of the previous soft forks have been activated using [BIP 9](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0009), which requires a (super)majority of miners (by hash power) to signal support for the upgrade. A proposed alternative is [BIP 8](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0008), which could activate the upgrade after some time even without a (super)majority of miners signaling support.

**The aim of this site is to assist in the activation of the Taproot soft fork. We have reached out to several Bitcoin mining pools to find out if:**
 
1. If they support the Taproot upgrade
1. If so, which activation method they prefer
1. If they want to insert a coinbase message in a block to announce their preference (even before the actual activation window opens)
