# Taproot Activation

## Taproot is a proposed Bitcoin protocol upgrade that can be deployed as a forward-compatible soft fork. By combining the Schnorr signature algorithm with MAST (Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees) and a new scripting language called Tapscript, Taproot will expand Bitcoinâ€™s smart contract flexibility, while offering more privacy by letting users mask complex smart contracts as a regular bitcoin transaction.

A soft fork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is forward-compatible. See more here: [Soft fork bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Softfork)

Soft forks can be activated in several ways. Several of the previous soft forks have been activated using [BIP 9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki) (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 9), which requires a (super)majority of miners (by hash power) to signal support for the upgrade. A proposed alternative is [BIP 8](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki), which could activate the upgrade after some time even without a (super)majority of miners signaling support. There are also ideas to combine BIP 9-style activation with BIP 8-style activation.

In short:
  
1. **BIP 9 (and BIP 8 without forced activation):** The upgrade will activate if and when 95% of hash power signals support for the upgrade. If after a year this threshold hasn't been reached, the upgrade expires. Both the 95% threshold and the one-year expiry parameters could be set differently.

1. **BIP 8 (with forced activation):** The upgrade will activate if and when 95% of hash power signals support for the upgrade. If after a year this threshold hasn't been reached, the upgrade activates regardless, and blocks that don't follow the new rules will be rejected. Both the 95% threshold and the one-year expiry parameters could be set differently.

There are also ideas to combine different proposals. For example, try BIP 9 first, if it expires, try again with BIP 8 (with forced activation). More in depth information on Taproot activation can be found in the Bitcoin Wiki [Taproot activation proposals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Taproot_activation_proposals) or in this Bitcoin Magazine article by Aaron van Wirdum: [BIP 8, BIP 9 Or Modern Soft Fork Activation: How Bitcoin Could Upgrade Next](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bip-8-bip-9-or-modern-soft-fork-activation-how-bitcoin-could-upgrade-next)

 
**The aim of this site is to assist in the activation of the Taproot soft fork. We have reached out to several Bitcoin mining pools to find out if:**
 
1. If they support the Taproot upgrade
1. If so, which activation method they prefer
1. What threshold hash power percentage should be met to activate the upgrade
1. How long it should take before activation either expires or is enforced
1. If they want to insert a coinbase message in a block to announce their preference (even before the actual activation window opens)
